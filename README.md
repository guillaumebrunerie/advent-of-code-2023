# Advent of code 2023

This is my code for the Advent of code 2023, my goal is to not only solve the
puzzles, but to also make a 16-second visualization for every day, all in a
similar style (more artistic than pedagogic), which can then be combined into a
final video of around 7 minutes.

You can check the visualizations that I have made so far at
